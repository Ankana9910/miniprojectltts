## INTRODUCTION
****
There's this simple calculator which we all have in our mobile phones or the one we get in the stationery shops.
Since years it has been doing the same job of arithmetically operating upon numbers and giving out the sum, product etc. But for us engineers; instead of taking a pen-paper to convert bits to bytes, centimeters to feets or calculating voltage or power through devices. 
To simplify this **CALCONV** has been introduced. 


**CALCONV** is a Calculator-Converter, which can be used to: 
1. Implement basic Arithmetic Operations
2. Implement Metric Conversions i.e Centimeters to Feet and Inches.
3. Implement Byte Conversions i.e from Kilobyte to Byte and MegaBytes
4. Electronic Converter which displays values of Power and Voltage for given Current and Resistance.

## RESEARCH

**FEATURES AND BENEFITS**:
The function of a calculator is to ease the manual calculation part. We use calculators mainly to do basic arithmetic operations for larger numbers or sometimes even smaller ones.
But the place where we get stuck is the conversion part. All sorts of conversions have been included in calculators except for byte,metric and electronic conversions. For this we have always approached GOOGLE or other converter sites.

 **USAGE**

>This calculator would be of great help to scientists, engineers or those working in the  Communications/Electronics/Mathematical branches in order to get their results posted in no time rather than taking a pen paper for such calculations.

**SAVES TIME**
>Undoubtedly it will save time. That's what calculators do;ease the manual working.

# COST AND FEATURES WITH TIME
****
**EARLIER VERSIONS**
 1. The idea of building a machine that could carry out arithmetic operations, came out in 1642, when Blaise Pascal invented the Arithmetic Machine.
2. The calculator featured a 12-digit display in red LED and cost $395 when it first went on sale in January 1971.
3. The first solid-state electronic calculator came out in the 1960s ; this is what we use today with certain advancements.

**CURRENT SCENARIO**
****
Nowadays there are two sorts of calculators that we use, one is the normal calculator and other is the scientific calculator. 


 
> None of the Calcuators provides such conversion options.
> Here in this calculator the basic is to acecpt user input to get to know what is actually going ot be done.

# **DEFINING OUR SYSTEM**
****
Prerequisites and Assumptions:
1. For calculation part(arithmetic) only two inputs are being considered
2. One sided conversion process is being shown here.

# EXPLANATION:

1. First we take an input from the user that what actually he wants to perform; Calculation or Digital Bit Conversion
2.Then The number is entered which is required to be checked.
3.From the dropdown menu, the choice of type of conversion/calculation is taken up
4.Result is displayed

## 4W'S AND 1'H

 ### **WHO**
***
The Mathematicians, Engineers and Scientists who revolve around works related to metrics and conversions.

### **WHAT**
****
The Calculator-Converter does more than just arithmetic calculations therefore becomes an aid to lots of calculation related problems, being accurate and easy to use.

### **WHEN**
***
The problem comes up when a calculator is felt short of functions that would satisfy one's need of calculations.

### **WHERE**
***
In the Science and Technology, Engineering Service Industry this is of a great use.

### **HOW**
Fast and Accurate result provision, which in turn saves time and energy of an individual.
