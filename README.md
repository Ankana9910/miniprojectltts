## Challenges Faced and How it were overcome

|S.no| Challenge|
|-----|---|
|1.| Unity Testing was an entirely new concept so effort was put to learn it first and then implement it.
| 2.| Making an application of Calculator-Converter using structures and functions was a new thing; earlier it was done by using just if-else or switch cases.
|3.|  In the requirements section, the information about the first release of calculator and comparing the pros and cons with what it is now in this application was a tedious job.
|4. | Making yml files and creating workflows was a new concept I learnt.
